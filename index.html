<p>I am a 16 year old high schooler who is currently inrolled in the Wake Tech CCP class of Web, Program, and Database Foundation, which is why this got made in the first place. This website is intened to (at some point after further refinment when the class is over) serve as a portfolio of sorts to help my career get into college.</p>
	&nbsp;

<p>That's a picture of me off to the right (apologies if it isn't loading). It was taken while working on the beginning stages of this website through a sub-par camera. I am currently enrolled at Apex Friendship High School and am in the 10th grade.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>I am looking for a career in some field of computers or engineering, which is why I am currently enrolled in this class. I have some expernece in these fields, which can be found on a differnt page on the navigation bar at the bottom.</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
	
<p>As this is the landing page it is admittedly a bit bare-bones, but that shouldn't stop any of this from being as informational as it needs to be. This is once again a class assignment first and foremost and I am still learning, so there may be some inconsistencies or other problems throughout your navigation of this website. Happy exploring!</p>
