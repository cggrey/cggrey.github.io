	<li>I am a teenager (16!) currently attending high school</li>
<p></p>
<li>I look like that picture to the right (yes its the same one as earlier)</li>
<p></p>
      <li>I'm a bit of a minimalist which is why most of these pages aren't that  spacious</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>I don't really have a favortie color but the red and blue used on this website look nice alongside a whole bunch of other colors I'm not going to list</li>

<p>Ready for the rapid-fire round? I live with my family of four in Raleigh NC. I don't travel that much but when I do it's usually to visit my grandmother who lives in Florida. I was born in January pretty closely to my dad's birthday. I have a twin sister who is older than me by a minute. The class I'm primarily making this for is my first college class. I don't have a job yet but am planning to get one over the summer. I like using weird symbols in various doodles to make them kind of pop. I'm not very artistic but I try occassionally. I like to mess around with computers and see what I can get them to do (like alt+shift+arrow keys used to be the keyboard shortcut for rotating the screen)</p>
