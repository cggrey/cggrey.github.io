          <h1>Goals and Aspirations</h1></header>
        <h2>As is clear from my experience and portrayal of myself, I am interested in an engineering career. I am also interested in computers and hope to combine the two into something to do for a living.</h2>

		<p>With my good grades and prior experiences (found on another section at the bottom) I would like to go to a good school and am aiming for NC state, Wake Tech, or something adjacent.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>As is stated several times at different places, I am still enrolled in high school and as such do not have the best grasp of college life or realistic future stages of my life.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>That being said, most jobs in the fields that I am interested in are interesting to me, pay well and are in relatively high demand, so it would be advantageous to try to investigate them as career options.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>As a backup plan however, I am rather good with math and numbers and will most likely then consider a career in those fields, such as an accountant or an actuary.</p>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <p>Overall not very much to say here, something with engineering, computers and maybe math as a career choice. College itself is currently two years off for me so the decision needn't be made now.</p>
